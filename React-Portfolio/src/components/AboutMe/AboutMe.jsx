            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>My name is Racheal Ameyaw. I transitioned from being a full-time Patient care assosicate to a full stack developer.
                 I completed a full stack development bootcamp at Ohio State University, which deepened my passion for programming and computers.
                  Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed the styling aspect of coding. This program has greatly expanded my knowledge in both front-end 
                  and back-end development, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.
            </p>
            <img src= {Family} alt="My Image" className="my-image" />
            <img src= {Portrait} alt="My Image" className="my-image" />
            <p>The projects linked in my portfolio are those I created during my current bootcamp. 
                I love to focus on design and add a personal touch when I have the time. I view these projects as achievements and 
                as opportunities for future improvement with the new skills I learn. 
                I was fortunate to collaborate on  group projects with the  dedicated team of full stack developers. 
                We all share a passion for the apps we built and plan to continue enhancing them to realize our vision.
